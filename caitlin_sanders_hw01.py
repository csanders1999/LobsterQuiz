# Caitlin Sanders
# CIS 400: Assignment 1
# Due February 8, 2019

# Directions:

# Create a Python module with a __main__  (in other words, create a runnable Python script), and at least 60 lines of code.
# Define at least 1 class, and at least 1 function for each class you have defined.
# Your __main__ should instantiate objects of the classes you have designed, and use them to invoke the methods defined in those classes.
# Use list comprehensions to create lists
# Use dictionary comprehensions to create dictionaries
# Use at least 1 decision-making statement (if-elif)
# Use at least 1 looping statement (for or while)
# Use at least 1 try-except to catch some exceptions
# Use the input() function, or command-line arguments, to get some user input
# Produce some interesting output
# Add comments to make your script easy to understand
# Be creative and make sure it runs.

# Question class with prompt and answer
class Question:
     def __init__(self, prompt, answer):
          self.prompt = prompt
          self.answer = answer

# List of question prompts
prompts = ["What color is lobster's blood? ","Where are lobster's teeth located? ","What do lobster's taste with? ","What state's university has a lobster institute?  ","What year did the beach-party anthem 'Rock Lobster' come out?  ","In what show did one of the main characters reasure their friend by saying, 'but sheâ€™s your lobster.'? ","Lobsters mate for life. True or False? ","Where is a lobster's brain located? ","Lobsters scream when you boil them. True or False? ","In what show is the show 'Bring in the dancing lobsters' from? ", "When it comes to mating, do males (M) or females (F) make the first move? ", "What are the red things in cooked lobster?
